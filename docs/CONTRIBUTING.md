## Submitting Pull Requests

### Getting Started

**Working on your first Pull Request?** You can learn how from this *free* series
[How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://kcd.im/pull-request).
See also [First Timers Only](http://www.firsttimersonly.com).

Search for any open or closed PR that relates to your submission.

If you don't find one:

  1. Fork https://github.com/cezelot/eve to your GitHub account.
  2. Clone the forked repository.
  3. Create a new git branch.
  4. Make your changes in the new branch.
  5. Commit your changes using a descriptive commit message that follows
     our [commit message conventions](#commit-message-guidelines).
  6. Push your branch to GitHub.
  7. Send a pull request to `eve:main`.

### Coding Style Guidelines

See the file [STANDARD.md](STANDARD.md) for details on the coding standard
used by this project.

Please follow this style to make eve easy to read, maintain and develop.

These coding rules are open for discussion, if you think another standardâ€™s specifications
makes eve better overall in an objective sense or anything else, please feel free to implement it,
or you can [start a new discussion](https://github.com/cezelot/eve/discussions/new?category=standard).

### Commit Message Guidelines

eve uses the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
specification.

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>
[BLANK LINE]
[optional body]
[BLANK LINE]
[optional footer(s)]
```

For consistency, please write in lowercase the first commit line, excluding
proper names (GitHub, ...) and file names (README.md, ...).

Try to keep the first commit line short. It's harder to do using this commit style but try to be
concise, and if you need more space, you can use the commit body. Try to make sure that the commit
subject is clear and precise enough that we will know what changed by just looking at the commit logs.

The commit subject may contain formatted inline code by using backticks:

 ```
 feat: add `--version` command-line option
 ```

That's it! Thank you for your contribution!
